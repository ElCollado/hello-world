Baby Steps in Data Sci

I have no idea what im doing

Elbin here, A short recap of my time here in Texas. I came from New York because I wanted to move away and experience life from a different perspective. My plan was to continue working in the solar energy industry. I gained interest in renewable energy in my undergrad and when i graduated I left my good pay job at costco to do something good in the world. After working as a solar consultant and a solar installer I found out that although I like the thought of working Solar, I actually did not enjoy the work. My first semester at UT was a litte stressful and I felt lost. My second semester was much better, however after being exposed to alittle data science from a short course I took this semester and watching youtube videos, Im trying a crack at it little by little. This Github account is another step to learn what data science is all about. I have another year left for my degree (hopefully) and I plan to use whats left to gain skills that will lead to an entry level data science job.
